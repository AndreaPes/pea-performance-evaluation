# Performance Evaluation — Assignments
Politecnico di Milano — Performance Evaluation and Application — _AY 2024–2025_

## About
Set of **16 assignments** covering core performance-evaluation topics. Computations and simulations are implemented in **Python** (NumPy, Matplotlib). The last two assignments use a **Java-based modeling tool**.

Deliverables:
- **Assignment reports**
- **Python sources**
- **Java modeling projects**

## Goal and requirements
- Analyze system models and derive analytical solutions when feasible.
- Build discrete-event simulations to validate/compare with analytics.
- Produce plots/tables and interpret results against the problem statement.
- Report assumptions, parameters, and confidence of estimates.

## Key learnings
- **Performance evaluation basics:** response time, throughput, utilization, confidence intervals, distributions, blocking, availability, reliability.
- **Measurement practice:** collect, clean, and interpret performance data to support model assumptions.
- **Workload & service characterization:** fit probability distributions; synthesize random traces from estimates.
- **Analytical modeling:** single service centers with multi-server and finite capacity; general inter-arrival/service times.
- **Discrete-event simulation:** build/validate simulators; handle multi-class workloads, fork/join, finite capacity, and adaptive policies.
- **Resource contention modeling:** use Petri Nets and related formalisms to capture synchronization and bottlenecks.
- **JMT proficiency:** model systems in Java Modelling Tool and interpret results alongside Python analyses.
- **Modern architectures:** reason about parallelism, resource sharing, dynamic allocation, centralized vs. distributed components, and high variability.
- **Optimization mindset:** use models to predict behavior and guide tuning for performance/energy trade-offs.
- **Learning through applications:** apply methods to case studies (e-health, cloud/autoscaling data centers, energy reduction, ML pipelines, smart cities).
